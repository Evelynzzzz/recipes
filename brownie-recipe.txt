Preparing the Meringue

1/2 cup aquafaba (see Note)
1/4 tsp cream of tartar
2/3 cup granulated organic sugar
1/3 cup packed light brown suga

Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). Prepare an 8- x 8-inch square pan with a sheet of parchment paper with the edges hanging over the sides of the pan. (To do this, place a piece of parchment across the pan, leaving the excess to drape over the sides — essentially creating “handles” for removing the baked brownies later.)

Add the aquafaba and cream of tartar to the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with the balloon whisk attachment. Whip the aquafaba on low for about 10 seconds to lighten. Raise the speed to medium and whip for 5 minutes. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue to whip for another 5 minutes or until the aquafaba holds firm peaks.

Add the granulated sugar, 2 tbsp at a time, and beat to blend. When all of the granulated sugar has been added, begin adding the brown sugar in the same fashion. This should take about 3 minutes to accomplish. Then, continue to whip for an additional 2 minutes or until the sugar has dissolved and the meringue is climbing the side of the bowl.

Note: The aquafaba acts as an emulsifier and light leavener in the brownies.
